# MI-SZZ - State Final Exam

All of these were done as a part of the preparation for the state exam on FIT CTU. It contains both common (compulsory) courses and MI-SP-SP (System Programming) courses materials. Almost all the materials are written in English, the rest of them is in Czech.

Sadly MI-SP-SP is no longer a thing, but it may still help with other subjects and future new branches of study.

Created for state final exam in winter 2019.
